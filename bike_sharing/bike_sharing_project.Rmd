# BIKE SHARING PROJECT

Project exercise from the "Data Science and machine Learning bootcamp with R" course (section 21) and based on the [Bike Sharing](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview) Kaggle competition.

Data available to download from the Kaggle website.

```{r required-libraries, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
install.packages(c(ggplot2))
require('ggplot2')
```

## GET THE DATA

```{r initial-data-frames}
training_data <- read.csv('data/train.csv')
test_data <- read.csv('data/test.csv')

head(training_data)
summary(training_data)
```

The variable we are trying to predict is `count`.
